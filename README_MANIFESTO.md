## Purpose
This manifesto establishes my intent to steward, evolve, and relicense the cultural and technical infrastructure rooted in the Dynebolic GNU/Linux distribution, the Netsukuku decentralized routing stack, and the legacy systems of FreakNet/Poetry Hacklab.

## Motivation
Since 2005, I have contributed to the preservation and reactivation of legacy infrastructure and ideologies embedded within the Dynebolic ecosystem. My work has involved:
- Reverse-engineering hybrid ISOs and mesh routing systems
- Unlocking ritualized hard drive sequences and modded Xbox nodes
- Integrating MoinMoin wiki farms, DC BY licenses, and P2P publishing stacks
- Maintaining and reestablishing forgotten mesh nodes across legacy servers

## Declaration
I hereby assert the right to:
- Fork and continue development under the spirit of the original licenses
- Apply new licensing terms where no explicit license prohibits it
- Publish future iterations under a “MeshFork License” (see below)
- Maintain attribution to all original authors, while introducing modern extensions and guardianship

## Respect to Origins
This revival acknowledges:
- The work of Jaromil and the Dyne.org foundation
- Contributions by TEH (Trans Europe Halles), FreakNet, and Medialab
- The cultural message of digital freedom embedded in each artifact

Signed,
