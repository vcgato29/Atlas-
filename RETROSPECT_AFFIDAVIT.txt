Victor José Corral – Historical Artifact Log Affidavit
Date: 2025-05-19T22:54:45.646456Z

This archive contains original photographic documentation of a period in 2018
where I, unintentionally and without malicious intent, accessed core authentication 
modules on macOS systems related to social media login mechanisms (Facebook, LinkedIn, iCloud, etc.).

These screenshots were taken during a phase of experimentation using Android tools and terminal interfaces. 
No data was sold, leaked, or weaponized.

I now preserve this archive strictly for historical and ethical documentation.
