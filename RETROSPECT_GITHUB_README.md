## RETROSPECT: My Legacy Statement

In 2018, I unknowingly accessed core authentication plugins on macOS systems (El Capitan).
Through Terminal IDE, ZShaolin, and curiosity, I uncovered `.bundle` modules used by Facebook, LinkedIn, iCloud, and others.

I took screenshots. I documented, but I never exploited.

Now, I preserve this record not for guilt — but for stewardship.

This repository, Atlas Mesh and all derived systems, carry a sealed record of that past:

- **Affidavit:** [`RETROSPECT_AFFIDAVIT.txt`](./RETROSPECT_AFFIDAVIT.txt)
- **Signature:** [`RETROSPECT_AFFIDAVIT.sig`](./RETROSPECT_AFFIDAVIT.sig)
- **Public Key:** [`RETROSPECT_GPG_PUBLIC_KEY.pem`](./RETROSPECT_GPG_PUBLIC_KEY.pem)
- **Artifact Log:** [`Victor_Historical_Artifact_Log.zip`](./Victor_Historical_Artifact_Log.zip)

Use it to remember what not to become.
